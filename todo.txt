graphing error when doing calculating time for reaching population with 2 models at the same time (check if fixed after doing time needed issue)
implement module 5
change the labels of lines in a graph to print the model its representing as it just says final, added, start on it (can also do subplots and have one graph for one model)
add limits to numbers
add plural checking in time amount input
for listing output use table instead
