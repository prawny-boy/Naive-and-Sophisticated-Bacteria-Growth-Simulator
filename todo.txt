optimise the fission events to convert when it is inputted and summarise as total fission events or 1 of a unit
implement the projected time output type setting (do after fixing time needed and optimising of fission events)
implement module 5
add plural checking in time amount input
time needed has to be seperate for each module as sandbox causing big errors
change the labels of lines in a graph to print the model its representing as it just says final, added, start on it (can also do subplots and have one graph for one model)
graphing error when doing calculating time for reaching population with 2 models at the same time (check if fixed after doing time needed issue)
fix the not working naive model target pop formula
add limits to numbers
issues with fission frequency in sophisticated models not caclulating properly when converting to total amount of fission events per growth rate unit
